## Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping 

### Assignment - Solution 

The following activities were accomplished to complete this assignment: 

1.  **Fork** the GitHub repository containing the stub R files at
    [https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2) to create a copy under your own account.
    > Forked the GitHub repository from the address mentioned above through Github web-based interface
    
2.  **Clone** your forked GitHub repository to your computer so that you can edit the files locally on your own machine.
    > `git clone https://github.com/pwjoshi/ProgrammingAssignment2.git`
    
3.  **Edit** the R file contained in the git repository and place your solution in that file (please do not rename the file).
    > `git add cachematrix.R README.md README_ProgrammingAssignment2_Original.md`

4.  **Commit** your completed R file into YOUR git repository and push your git branch to the GitHub repository under your account.
    > `git add README_ProgrammingAssignment2_Original.md`
    > `git commit -m "Renamed the original README.md from rdpeng/ProgrammingAssignment2"`
    > `git push`
    > ` `
    > `git add README.mdi`
    > `git commit -m "Assignment summary - Caching the Inverse of a Matrix"`
    > `git push`
    > ` `
    > `git add cachematrix.R`
    > `git commit -m "Updated pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix"`
    > `git push`

5.  **Submit** to Coursera the URL to your GitHub repository that contains the completed R code for the assignment.
    > [https://github.com/pwjoshi/ProgrammingAssignment2](https://github.com/pwjoshi/ProgrammingAssignment2) 
    
    
### Assignment - URL and SHA-1 hash 

In addition to submitting the URL for your GitHub repository, you will need to submit the 40 character SHA-1 hash 
(as string of numbers from 0-9 and letters from a-f) that identifies the repository commit that contains the version 
of the files you want to submit. You can do this in GitHub by doing the following


1. Going to your GitHub repository web page for this assignment

2. Click on the **?? commits** link where ?? is the number of commits you have in the repository. 
   For example, if you made a total of 10 commits to this repository, the link should say 10 commits.

3. You will see a list of commits that you have made to this repository. The most recent commit is at the very top. 
   If this represents the version of the files you want to submit, then just click the copy to clipboard 
   button on the right hand side that should appear when you hover over the SHA-1 hash. Paste this SHA-1 hash 
   into the course web site when you submit your assignment. If you don't want to use the most recent commit, 
   then go down and find the commit you want and copy the SHA-1 hash.

The following is the valid **URL** and **SHA-1 hash** submission


```r
    https://github.com/pwjoshi/ProgrammingAssignment2
